# UWB 2021 Hacks From Home: _A New Course Evaluation Catalog_

### Our Goal
Although filled with an ample amount of information and statistics, UW's current Course Evaluation Catalog lacks user friendliness and its outdated design turns off many who look to the website for advice. We wanted to design a new course catalog system that would improve the usability of the site by enhancing its accessibility and design. Data is highly important for the online format due to Covid-19 and should be accessible for all students in need of accessing it. 
### User Experience
Our new design has a search bar, a much more practical way of searching through thousands of classes. Users can directly search the course they want to see evaluations from and data will immediately populate with the course name, the instructor name and the quarter it was taught. We also redesigned the subpages that provide teacher ratings and statistics. The old design provided a dense table that was hard to decipher; we wanted to improve this by providing easy-to-read figures and accompanying visuals.
### Implementation Details
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Figma
### Some Issues

### Future Steps
In the future we would like to display trends in teacher ratings so students can be aware of whether or not a professor is changing their course design. We would also like to implement a function where students can build a preliminary schedule and see how rigorous their schedule might be compared to the average schedule. We would like to use this design and offer it to the school so all students can have accessible data.
