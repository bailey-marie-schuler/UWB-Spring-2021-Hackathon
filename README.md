# UWB 2021 Hacks From Home: _A New Course Evaluation Catalog_
### UWB Hacks 2021 Track
Tools Track (Helping other students achieve success while learning from home)
### Our Goal
Although filled with an ample amount of information and statistics, UW's current Course Evaluation Catalog lacks user friendliness and its outdated design turns off many who look to the website for advice. We wanted to design a new course catalog system that would improve the usability of the site by enhancing its accessibility and design. Data is highly important for the online format due to Covid-19 and should be accessible for all students in need of accessing it. 
### User Experience
Our new design has a search bar, a much more practical way of searching through thousands of classes. Users can directly search the course they want to see evaluations from and data will immediately populate with the course name, the instructor name and the quarter it was taught. We also redesigned the subpages that provide teacher ratings and statistics. The old design provided a dense table that was hard to decipher; we wanted to improve this by providing easy-to-read figures and accompanying visuals.
## How we built it 
We wanted to make a user-centric website so we first designed our website using the UI tool Figma. In Figma we made sure to use contrast in fonts and images to make the website easy to read and easy to use. After we created our design of the website we ran several user-studies to make sure our design was accessible to users of the site. We then used a mix of html and JavaScript to create the website following the design made in Figma. We also created artificial datasets, to make sure we did not violate the school's privacy, and a database to access information from the search bar on the website. We formatted the artificial data into an excel spreadsheet where we could access the information from the database. 
### Implementation Details
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Figma
### Some Issues
Most of our team are fairly new programmers and have no experience with databases, but that is what hackathons are for! We struggled creating our database in html on our website. Another challenge we faced was extracted data with the search function on the website. Ultimately if we had more time we would work out these bugs, but it was an incredible learning experience. 
### Future Steps
In the future we would like to display trends in teacher ratings so students can be aware of whether or not a professor is changing their course design. We would also like to implement a function where students can build a preliminary schedule and see how rigorous their schedule might be compared to the average schedule. Our next steps would be to reach out to the University of Washington, who has already expressed concern about this outdated website, and help integrate our design into their current framework as a team. This would allow them to showcase their students work and ultimately have a much needed website renovation for free!

Before submitting the project to the University of Washington to use we would have to make sure all of the front end code matches the figma file and that our search bar can access our artificial data. For this to work for the University of Washington would have to have access to their catalog database to get the data for the course evaluation and integrate into our design.
